### Major Update

This commit is a major refactor of Waffles.

This repository can be considered Waffles "core". It contains the core functionality of Waffles as a suite of Bash scripts. These scripts can be sourced into any Bash script and then used to manage resources. The `init.sh` script can also be source on the command-line and the user can interactively execute the Waffles-based resources.

Functionality that has been removed from this repository (data, profiles, stacks) will appear in separate repositories.

The previous incarnation of Waffles exists under the `0.22` branch. This branch will be maintained for a short time and will receive patches where appropriate.

### Fixes

* `os.symlink` heavily rewritten so options make more sense.

## 0.22.0 June 4, 2016

### Major Update

The concept of `stdlib` was removed from Waffles. See [this commit](https://github.com/jtopjian/waffles/commit/fbe51753e446755018007a69fa10f1ed7950e670) for details. You can use the `contrib/legacy_migration.sh` script to convert your work. For now, all old `stdlib.*` resource calls should be caught and a warning will be printed. This will be removed in a future release.

### Features

* New Feature: `wafflescript`: Run a Waffles script by using `#!/usr/local/bin/wafflescript` as the interpreter.
* New Feature: Waffleseeds: Compile a Waffles Role into a self-contained executable.

## 0.1.0 - June 9, 2015

Waffles initial release.

Waffles is a simple configuration management and deployment system written in Bash. I started this project both to see if such a tool was possible as well as to create a more simple deployment system for my own experiments.

The initial release of Waffles contains a variety of resources and documentation. It's able to configure local nodes as well as remote nodes via `rsync`.

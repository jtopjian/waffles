# Identical Platforms and Suites are defined because the purpose of the tests
# are two-fold:
#
# 1. Make sure the individual resources run without error.
#    This is done in the provisioning script of the platform.
#
# 2. Run the entire test again to make sure no changes are required.
#    This is done in the includes portion of the suite.
#
# If anyone knows a better way to do this, please let me know. :)
